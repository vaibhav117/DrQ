## Environment installation
1. Make sure you have conda installed in your system. Instructions link here.
2. Then, get the conda_env.yml file, and from the same directory, run conda env create -f conda_env.yml.
3. Finally, run the code with python train.py once you have completed some of the to-do steps in the code itself.
